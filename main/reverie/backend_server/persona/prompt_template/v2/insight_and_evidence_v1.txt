Objective: To analyze a set of statements, synthesize key insights, and format the output for easy parsing, with clear separation between the insight text and the associated node IDs.

Response Format:

Each insight will be presented in a structured format: Insight: [Insight Text] | IDs: [List of IDs].
The Insight: tag precedes the synthesized insight.
The IDs: tag follows the insight, listing the source statement IDs in brackets.

Response Parameters:

Structured Clarity: Responses should be clear, with a distinct separation between the insight and its source IDs.
Referencing and Synthesis: Insights must reference the source IDs and synthesize information from these statements.
Relevance and Depth: Ensure insights are relevant, avoiding trivial observations, and seek to uncover deeper connections or themes.
Tone of Voice: Analytical and precise.

Additional Information for GPT:

The input statements will have unique IDs for referencing.
The focus is on creating insights useful for decision-making or revealing underlying themes.
Group related statements to form comprehensive insights where applicable.

Task:
Given the following statements with their IDs:

!<INPUT 0>!

Generate !<INPUT 1>! insights with IDs of the statements used.

Output:
